# Voice Recording Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. API Request Format
**Problem**: The original code was making direct calls to OpenAI API from the client, which can cause CORS issues and authentication problems.

**Solution**: Created a server-side API endpoint (`/api/transcribe`) that handles the OpenAI API call server-side.

### 2. FormData Handling
**Problem**: React Native FormData format was not properly configured for the OpenAI API.

**Solution**: 
- Updated FormData creation to use proper React Native format
- Added server-side endpoint that properly formats the request for OpenAI
- Removed client-side Content-Type header (let the browser set it for multipart/form-data)

### 3. Error Handling
**Problem**: Limited error information when API calls failed.

**Solution**: 
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the transcription process
- Enhanced error messages with specific status codes and response text
- Added success/failure alerts for better user feedback

### 4. Environment Variables
**Problem**: API key might not be accessible in all contexts.

**Solution**: 
- Added both `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY` to .env.local
- Server-side endpoint uses `OPENAI_API_KEY` (more secure)
- Client-side fallback uses `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY`

## Files Modified

1. **app/(tabs)/index.tsx** - Updated transcription function to use server endpoint
2. **app/(tabs)/api/transcribe+api.ts** - New server-side transcription endpoint
3. **.env.local** - Added both environment variable formats

## How It Works Now

1. User holds microphone button to record
2. Audio is recorded using expo-av
3. Audio file is sent to `/api/transcribe` endpoint
4. Server endpoint forwards the request to OpenAI Whisper API
5. Transcription result is returned to client
6. Text appears in input field for user to review and send

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Run `npm start`
2. Open the app on a device/simulator
3. Grant microphone permissions when prompted
4. Hold the microphone button and speak
5. Release the button
6. Wait for "Transcribing..." to complete
7. Check that text appears in the input field

## Debugging

If issues persist, check the console logs for:
- "Starting transcription for URI: ..."
- "FormData created, making API request to server..."
- "Response status: ..."
- "Transcription result: ..."

The enhanced logging will help identify exactly where the process fails.
